\section{Kinship matrices}
The kinship matrix is foundational for random effects models with family
data.  
For $n$ subjects it is an $n \times n$ matrix whose $ij$ element contains
the expected fraction of alleles that are identical by descent (IBD)for subject
$i$ and $j$.
Note that the diagonal elements of the matrix will be 0.5 not 1: if I randomly
sample two alleles of one of your genes, with replacement, 1/2 the time I get
a father/father or mother/mother pair (IBD) and the other 1/2 the time get
one of each.  
The truely astute reader will recognize that values >.5 can occur due to
inbreeding, but I'll leave that discussion for others.                    %'

The algorithm used is that found in K Lange, 
\emph{Mathematical and Statistical  Methods for Genetic Analysis}, 
Springer 1997, page 71--72.
It starts by setting the rows/columns for founders to .5 time the identity
matrix, they require no further processing.  
Parents must be processed before their children, and then a child's        %'
kinship is a sum of the kinship's for his/her parents.                     %'

Start by using the [[kindepth]] routine to label each subject's depth in   %'
the pedigree.  
The initial matrix suffices for all those of depth 0, then process
depth 1, etc.
This guarrantees that parent's precede children.                            %'
Founders are given a fake parent with id of n+1 who is unrelated to 
himself -- a little trick that avoids some if-else logic.

The most non-obvious part of the algorithm is the inner loop over [[i]].
It looks like a natural candidate for S-vectorization, but you cannot.
The key is [[kmat[mom,] + kmat[dad,] ]]: as we walk through a set of
siblings these vectors change, the $i$th element goes from 0 to the
appropriate value for that sib.  The dependence of each sib on prior
ones is what creates the correct between-sib correlation terms. 
The impact of the inner loop is not so dreadful, however, since this
function is run once per family.  A study may have thousands of
subjects but individual families within it are more modest in size.

The program can be called with a pedigree, a pedigree list, or
raw data.  The first argument is [[id]] instead of the more generic [[x]]
for backwards compatability.
<<kinship>>=
kinship <- function(id, ...) {
    UseMethod('kinship')
    }

kinship.default <- function(id, dadid, momid, ...) {
    n <- length(id)
    if (any(duplicated(id))) stop("All id values must be unique")
    kmat <- diag(n+1) /2
    kmat[n+1,n+1]    <- 0 

    pdepth <- kindepth(id, dadid, momid)
    mrow <- match(momid, id, nomatch=n+1) #row number of the mother
    drow <- match(dadid, id, nomatch=n+1) #row number of the dad 

    for (depth in 1:max(pdepth)) {
        indx <- (1:n)[pdepth==depth]
        for (i in indx) {
            mom <- mrow[i]
            dad <- drow[i]
            kmat[i,]  <- kmat[,i] <- (kmat[mom,] + kmat[dad,])/2
            kmat[i,i] <- (1+ kmat[mom,dad])/2
            }
        }
    
    kmat <- forceSymmetric(Matrix(kmat[1:n,1:n]))
    dimnames(kmat) <- list(id, id)
    kmat
    }

The method for a pedigree object is not quite trivial.  Since the
mother and father are already indexed into the id list it has 
two lines that are different, those that create mrow and drow.
Otherwise it is a complete repeat.
<<kinship>>=
kinship.pedigree <- function(id, ...) {
    n <- length(id$id)
    if (any(duplicated(id$id))) stop("All id values must be unique")
    kmat <- diag(n+1) /2
    kmat[n+1,n+1]    <- 0 

    pdepth <- kindepth(id)
    mrow <- ifelse(id$mindex ==0, n+1, id$mindex)
    drow <- ifelse(id$findex ==0, n+1, id$findex)

    for (depth in 1:max(pdepth)) {
        indx <- (1:n)[pdepth==depth]
        for (i in indx) {
            mom <- mrow[i]
            dad <- drow[i]
            kmat[i,]  <- kmat[,i] <- (kmat[mom,] + kmat[dad,])/2
            kmat[i,i] <- (1+ kmat[mom,dad])/2
            }
        }
    
    kmat <- forceSymmetric(Matrix(kmat[1:n,1:n]))
    dimnames(kmat) <- list(id$id, id$id)
    kmat
    }

For the Minnesota Family Cancer Study there are 461 families and 26050
subjects.  The raw kinship matrix would be 26050 by 26050 which is over
5 terabytes of memory, something that clearly won't work within S.       %'
The solution is to store the overall matrix as a sparse Matrix object.
Each family forms a single block.  For this study we have
[[n <- table(minnbreast$famid); sum(n*(n+1)/2)]] or 1.07 million entries;
only the lower half of each matrix is stored.

The result of each call to kinship will be a symmetric matrix, stored in
either dense or sparse form depending on the number of zeros.
The sparse form (dsCMatrix class) keeps only the
non-zero elements along with two vectors of indices; this is the form 
we want for the final result.
The work is to simply string together the components of the individual 
dsCMatrix objects with appropriate updates to the indices, i.e., the
second matrix does not start at row 1.
The code is actually even more frugal: subjects in the pedigree who have
no genetic connections, i.e., those who have married in but have no children
in the data set, can be treated as individual $1 \times 1$ blocks, and are
placed at the tail of each family.  
(This last is useful to the coxme function which uses bdsmatrix objects,
it is not clear that it adds value for functions in the Matrix 
library and it may be dropped at a later date).


Why don't we use [[(i in famlist)]] below?  A numeric subscript of [[[9]]] %'
selects the ninth family, not the family labeled as 9, so a numeric
family id would not act as we wished.
If all of the subject ids are unique, across all families, the final
matrix is labeled with the subject id, otherwise it is labeled with
family/subject.

kinship.pedigreeList <- function(id, ...) {
    plist <- id  #rename, to make the code below easier to read
    if (any(duplicated(plist$id))) addfamid <- TRUE

The older [[makekinship]] function,
from before the creation of pedigreeList objects,
accepts the raw identifier data, along with a special family code
for unrelated subjects, as produced by the [[makefamid]] function.
All the unrelated subjects are put at the front of the kinship matrix
in this case rather than at the end of a family.
Because unrelateds get put into a fake family, we cannot create a
rational family/subject identifier; the id must be unique across
families.
Like most routines, this starts out with a collection of error checks.
